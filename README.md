## JavaScript Exam

## This exercise is for JavaScript test designed by html, tailwind, flowbite, JavaScript and TypeScript.

This test includes an input to receive numbers along with four buttons.

The first button: determine the content of the input as a five-digit random number and display it on the console.

The second button: add five of the numbers stored in the input in a list and display that list in the console.

The third button: empty the input value.

The fourth button: checking whether all the input contents are numbers or not and displaying the error with the alert() code.
Considering that the first button enters all the input content in the form of numbers, this error will almost never be seen.

I took help from JPT chat to answer this exam.
